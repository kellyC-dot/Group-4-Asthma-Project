# 1.Description of dataset:

# What is the data source? (1-2 sentences on where the data is coming from, 
# dates included, etc.)

# Dataset 1: 

# Datasets 1 and 2 are both part of the California Communities 
# Environmental Health Screening Tool 
# (CalEnviroScreen), which was developed by the 
# Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, or # OEHHA, 
# an office within the California Environmental Protection Agency.

# This update to CalEnviroScreen, Version 4.0 was released in Octobober 2021, 
# and is an "evolving science-based method for identifying impacted communities
# by taking into consideration pollution exposure and its effects, 
# as well as health and socioeconomic status, at the census-tract level."

#Dataset 3 (Avinia to insert)

# How does the dataset relate to the group problem statement and question?

# Dataset 1 includes 21 statewide environmental measures (indicators) which 
# characterize both Pollution Burden (Exposures and Environmental Effects) and 
# Population Characteristics (Sensitive Populations and Socioeconomic Factors). 
# Asthma, in the dataset, is defined as one of the Sensitive Populations. 
# This allows us to link all of the environmental measures to people with 
# asthma, by county, age, race and ethnicity information. 
# Dataset 1 will be useful to identify which specific types of interventions
# could be undertaken to improve outcomes for people with asthma living in
# counties disproportionately affected by air pollution.

# Dataset 1 derives scores using percentiles for each of the 21 indicators in a 
# given geographic area. 
# Scores are averaged for the set of indicators in each of the four components
# (Exposures, Environmental Effects, Sensitive Populations, 
# and Socioeconomic Factors).
# Linking data from Dataset 1 to Dataset 3, which includes ED visits for asthma
# by county and demographics, may provide further evidence for 
# targeted interventions.
 
# Dataset 2 combines the four component scores to produce a CalEnviroScreen 
# score for a given place relative to other places in the state,


# 2. Import statements for all datasets:

# NOTE: Please use datasets available in the PHW251 Project Data github 
# repoLinks to an external site. 
# Use appropriate import function and package based on the type of file
# Utilize function arguments to control relevant components 
# (i.e. change column types, column names, missing values, etc.)
# Document the import process
# Clean up column names (recommend using snake case, which is lower case text with underscores between words)

```{r}

# Import dataset 1

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
file_path_csv <- ("home/rstudio/asthma_group4/data/calenviroscreen_
  measures_2021.csv")
  
asthma_measures <- read_csv(file_path_csv)



```

# 3. Identify data types for 5+ data elements/columns/variables:

# Identify 5+ data elements required for your specified scenario. 
# If <5 elements are required to complete the analysis, please choose 
# additional variables of interest in the data set to explore in this milestone.

# Utilize functions or resources in RStudio to determine the types of 
# each data element (i.e. character, numeric, factor)
# Identify the desired type/format for each variableâ€”will you need to
# convert any columns to numeric or another type? 


# 4. Provide a basic description of the 5+ data elements:

# Numeric: mean, median, range
# Character: unique values/categories
# Or any other descriptives that will be useful to the analysis


# 5. Describe cleaning that each data source may need:

# NOTE: There is no requirement for any data cleaning in this milestone, 
# but there may be cleaning you can do when you import your data! 
# Please list out the anticipated data cleaning needed. 
# Examples:
# Data elements that need to be converted to a different type
# Data elements that need cleaning or re-categorization
# Data elements that may be used for future joins (i.e. state, county)
